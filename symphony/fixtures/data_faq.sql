To meet the\r\ndefinition of research with human subjects, the proposal must constitute\r\nresearch and it must obtain information from human subjects. Research is\r\ndefined as any social science, biomedical, behavioral, or epidemiological\r\nactivity that entails systematic collection or analysis of data, with the\r\nintent to develop generalizable knowledge. Human subjects are defined as human\r\nbeings (i) who become individually identifiable through investigator’s\r\ncollection, preparation, or use of biological material or medical or other\r\nrecords, or (ii) who are exposed to manipulation, intervention, observation, or\r\nother interaction with investigators either directly or through alteration of\r\ntheir environment. Research with human subjects includes studies that use\r\ntissues, samples, data or records from humans, as well as studies that involve\r\nthe conduction of interviews, focus groups or surveys, or the observation of\r\nprivate behavior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Activities that do not constitute research with human\r\nsubjects are exempted from ethics review. These are activities that do not aim\r\nat the production of generalizable knowledge or do not involve human subjects\r\nin the ways described above. For example, the following activities do not\r\nconstitute research with human subjects and are thus exempted from ethics\r\nreview:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Studies using data that are publicly available or\r\ngenerated by observation of public behavior.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Studies using data, samples, or tissue that already exist\r\n(i.e. the data, samples or tissue have been obtained by others) and are\r\nreceived by the research team in such a manner that the identity of the\r\nindividuals cannot be established.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Public health activities conducted under recognized public\r\nhealth authority with the intent to prevent or control of disease or injury,\r\nincluding surveillance activities aimed only at the identification or control\r\nof a health problem. These are activities that seek the benefit of the\r\nparticipants or the participants’ communities, and do not intend to generate\r\nknowledge that is applicable to other populations.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Quality assurance activities or program evaluations aimed\r\nat improving the program at stake, and with no intent to produce generalizable\r\nknowledge.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Projects might involve multiple components, some of which\r\nmight constitute research with human subjects while other components might not.\r\nThe components that constitute research with human subjects should undergo\r\nethics review. Determinations about whether a proposal is exempted from ethics\r\nreview should be made by an independent party such as an ethics review\r\ncommittee.</p>');
